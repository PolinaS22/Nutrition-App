# Nutrition App

## Introduction

The Nutrition App is a React-based web application that allows users to input ingredients and receive detailed nutritional information for their meals or recipes. This app is designed to help users make informed decisions about their diet by providing easy access to nutritional data.

## Features

- Input multiple ingredients with quantities
- Fetch and display detailed nutritional information
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions
- Loading indicator for API requests
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Link to a related Recipes app

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
- **useState and useEffect Hooks**: For managing component state and side effects.
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the Edamam Nutrition API.
- **SweetAlert2**: For displaying user-friendly error messages.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

These technologies were chosen to create a modern, efficient, and user-friendly web application with smooth data fetching and state management capabilities.

## RESTful API Usage

The Nutrition App integrates with the Edamam Nutrition API, which follows RESTful principles. Here's how the API is utilized in the application:

1. **API Endpoint**: The app makes POST requests to the Edamam Nutrition API endpoint:
   `https://api.edamam.com/api/nutrition-details`

2. **Authentication**: The app uses API credentials (API_ID and API_KEY) for authentication. These are included as query parameters in the API URL.

3. **Request Method**: The app uses the POST method to send data to the API. This is appropriate for submitting new data (in this case, the list of ingredients) to the server.

4. **Request Headers**: The app sets the following headers for the API request:
   - 'Accept': 'application/json'
   - 'Content-Type': 'application/json'
   These headers indicate that the app is sending and expecting to receive JSON data.

5. **Request Body**: The app sends the list of ingredients as a JSON object in the request body. The ingredients are first split into an array and then stringified.

6. **Response Handling**: The app checks the response status:
   - If the response is successful (response.ok is true), it parses the JSON data and updates the app state with the nutritional information.
   - If there's an error, it displays a user-friendly error message using SweetAlert2.

7. **Asynchronous Operations**: The API call is made asynchronously using async/await syntax, ensuring that the app remains responsive while waiting for the API response.

8. **State Updates**: The nutritional data received from the API is stored in the app's state (using the setNutrition function), which then triggers a re-render to display the information to the user.

This implementation allows the app to efficiently communicate with the Edamam Nutrition API, send user input, and receive and display nutritional data in a user-friendly manner.

## How to Use

1. Enter ingredients with their quantities in the input field. Separate each ingredient with a comma.
Example: "1 apple, 2 bananas, 100g chicken breast"
2. Click the "Submit" button or press Enter.
3. The app will fetch and display the nutritional information for the entered ingredients.
4. If there's an error, the app will show a user-friendly error message.

## API Integration

This app uses the Edamam Nutrition API to fetch nutritional data. The API call is made using the following credentials:

- API_ID
- API_KEY

Note: In a production environment, these credentials should be stored securely and not exposed in the client-side code.

## Component Structure

- **App.js**: The main component that handles state management, API calls, and renders child components.
- **Info.js**: Displays individual nutritional information items.
- **Ingr.js**: Likely displays the list of entered ingredients.
- **LoaderPage.js**: Displays a loading indicator during API requests.
